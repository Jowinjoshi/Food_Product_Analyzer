## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Backend dependencies from your `requirements.txt`

### 1. Frontend Setup
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API server
py simple_api_minimal.py
```

### 3. Run Both Simultaneously (Recommended)
```bash
# Run both frontend and backend together
npm run dev:full
```

This command uses `concurrently` to run both the Next.js dev server and Python API server at the same time.

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Endpoints
The frontend connects to these backend endpoints:
- `POST /food/predict-disease` - Health risk prediction
- `GET /food/search` - Food database search
- `POST /food/analyze` - Food analysis
- `GET /food/categories` - Food categories
- `GET /food/healthy` - Healthy food recommendations

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend root:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
